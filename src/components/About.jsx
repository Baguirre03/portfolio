        <p>
          Hey! I am currently a university student at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.luc.edu/">Loyola University Chicago</a>. Here I
          am studying marketing with a minor in computer science. About halfway
          through my collegiate journey and some marketing internships, I found
          that coding was a better fit for me. Since then, I have been learning
          web development via{" "}
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There I am also an active community member and contribute as much as I
          can since its an open source curriculum! Apart from coding and
          marketing, I love to do Wordle, listen to music and podcasts, and
          doodle, and take photos with my film camera (as seen above).
