      <p>
        Hey! I am currently a university student at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.luc.edu/">Loyola Univeristy Chicago</a>. Here I am
        studying marketing with a minor in computer science. About halfway
        through my collegiate joruney and some marketing internships, I found
        that coding was a better fit for me. Since then, I have been learning
        web development by using{" "}
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There I am also an active community member, and contribute as much as I
        can since its an open source curriculum! Apart from coding and
        marketing, I love to do Wordle, listen to music and podcasts, and hang
        out with people!
